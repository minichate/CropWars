2. Can be written in any reasonable language or platform. If you want to write
   CUDA, OpenCL or LOLCODE, go for it. It simply has to work and be fast.
3. Must run on a single machine - no cloud solutions. Code will be
   tested on a MacBook with a 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7 and 8 GB of RAM.
4. No rediculous hacks or bending rule #1 - this must be something that could
   (with some work, obviously) be used in production.
5. Submission will be accepted by pull requests.
