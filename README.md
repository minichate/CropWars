Crop Wars 2012
==============

Rules
-----
1. Chop one of the following images into 1000 equally sized images that comprise
   entire image, 24 times. This should result in 24,000 images.
       - [image.bmp](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/37082018/image.bmp)
       - [image.tiff](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/37082018/image.tiff)
2. Can be written in any reasonable language. If you want to utilize CUDA,
   OpenCL or write LOLCODE, go for it. It simply has to work and be fast.
   Feel free to use any third party libraries along the way.
3. Must run on a single machine - no cloud solutions. Code will be
   tested on a MacBook with a 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7 and 8 GB of RAM.
4. No rediculous hacks or bending rule #1 - this must be something that could
   (with some work, obviously) be used in production.
5. Make your submissions via pull request.
